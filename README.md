# Odin Recipes Project
This project is a simple HTML-based website created as part of the Foundation Course of The Odin Project. 
The goal was to design a simple website featuring a Recipes homepage and three recipe pages.
Throughout the development process, I learned and practiced several fundamental HTML concepts, aside from some delicious recipes I will definitely try to recreate.
Key learnings I had with this first project:
- A better understanding of web structure and the importance of clear, simple navigation.
- A hands-on approach to applying basic HTML tags in a real-world project.
- Confidence in linking pages and managing content in a multi-page website.
