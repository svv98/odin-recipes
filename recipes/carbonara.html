    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that's so creamy, you'd swear there's a good amount of cream in it. 
        And indeed, there's plenty of recipes that cheat by adding in cream.
    </p>    
    <p>
        But today, we're making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way. 
        No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>175g/6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>100g/3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano, finely shredded</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>400g/14 oz spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the guanciale into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
        <li>Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
        <li>Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
        <li>Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water.</li>
        <li>Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
        <li>Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
