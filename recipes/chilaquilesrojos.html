                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a pan with oil, fry the tortillas until they are golden and crispy. Then drain them and set them aside to continue with the preparation.</li>
                    <li>In a blender, combine the chiles, tomato, and garlic, and blend until you get a smooth sauce.</li>
                    <li>In the same pan where the tortillas were fried (with just a little oil), add the sauce and saut√© it for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the water and salt to taste, and let it simmer for a bit. </li>
                    <li>Once it starts to boil, add the fried tortillas and stir for a few minutes until the flavors concentrate</li>
                    <li>Let the tortillas absorb some of the sauce's moisture and soften a little.</li>
                    <li>Once the chilaquiles are ready, serve them on a plate and top them with crumbled queso fresco for an extra burst of flavor.</li>
                </ol>
